# Introduction

This repo is intended to develop lessons for learning COBOL, keeping source
code, and sample data files.  The code will be stored in `src`, the data in
`dat`, and the lesson files in `lesson` for now.


# Sources

Some of the program sources we used are from the following locations:

* http://www.csis.ul.ie/cobol/examples/default.htm

# Setup

We will need to discuss how to have people set up COBOL on their system --
perhaps install locally or we can save off a VM and do this.
